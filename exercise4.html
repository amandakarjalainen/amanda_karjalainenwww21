                    <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so. I had zero experience about making web pages a while ago and it surely is not anything great now either.
                        But this is actually quite fun and I have been enjoying practising a lot to see improvements. 
                        I think it is not too hard and you can figure things out easily by yourself. Google is your friend.
                        <br><br>
                        Before 2020 fall, my experience in programming was next to none. I had familiarized myself with Python's basics, 
                        but that's it. Nowadays, having some knowledge about Java and Python, I have noticed it certainly helps with 
                        making web pages. It is completely different sure, but in problem solving it benefits.</p>

                <!--The second chapter-->
                <article>
                    <div class = "figure">
                        <figure><img src = "images/planning.jpg" alt = "A working woman" width = "320px" height = "213.12px" class = "responsive">
                            <figcaption>Take your time to plan what do you want<br> your page to have and what it should look like.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <h2>CONTENT</h2>
                    <p>Well then, what there should be inside a <b>&lt;content&gt;</b> tag? The content <u>you want</u> there to be, of course! 
                        It should be unique though. Do not repeat the same things you would put in sidebars, navigation bars, a footer 
                        etc.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It includes <b>headings</b> inside different heading tags like the largest <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;h2&gt;</b> and so on till 
                            the smallest <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b>.</li>
                        <li><b>Paragraphs &lt;p&gt;</b> are good, short or longer. Whatever suits purpose and fits the page.</li>  
                        <li><b>Images and videos!</b> It is quite usual to see any sized pictures on modern webpages. 
                            Invest in good visuals alongside the workability of a web page.</li> 
                        <li>Do not forget <b>captions</b> for the images if they need one!</li>
                        <li>You could include <b>a table of contents</b> to give a brief overview of the page.</li>
                        <li>Remember to check that all the elements are responsive!</li>
                    </ul>
