                <p>The Marantaceae are a family of flowering plants, composed of about 31 genera and over 500 species. 
                    Species of this family are native to moist tropical forests of Americas, Africa and Asia. 
                    But the most of the species in this family are seen in the American tropics. 
                    The Marantaceae like evenly high humid and warm habitat. 
                    They do not need a lot of light as they are used to grow under a canopy of large trees. 
                    Alternative names for this plant family are the arrowroot family and the prayer plant family. 
                    The plant's less formal nickname is praying hands due to its shape in the night time as it goes to sleep.</p>

                <h2 style = "font-size: 30px;">Appearance</h2>
                <p>Marantaceae are largely rhizomatous and vary from being slender stalks to leafy spreading or dense bushes. 
                    The most known genera in the family are Maranta, Calathea, and Stromanthe possibly because of 
                    their rise to being loved and wanted house plants thanks to their large green leaves full of beautiful markings. 
                    The marks may vary in shades of white and dark red. 
                    The underside of leaves and the stem may be dark red depending the species. 
                    Leaves are usually oval, round or spear-shaped and foliage is dense, which make these plants unique eye-catchers. 
                    They appear in multiple sizes - some species grow height, even to two meters at the highest, 
                    and others spread horizontally. Because the Marantaceae are used to a shady environment with soft light, 
                    they curl up easily if they get too much light. This may happen when having one as a house plant. 
                    When the plant is content, the leaf is flat and the base color is deep green. 
                    Some species bloom a whiteish flower and in some cases the flower is so moderate it is hard to notice. 
                    As the house plant it is hard to get this family's species to blossom.</p>

                <h2 style = "font-size: 30px;">Habitat</h2>
                <p>The tropical forests of Americas, Africa and Asia are the place where Marantaceae family's species thrive. 
                    Approximately 80% of the species grow in Americans forests, 11% in Asia and the rest 9% in Africa. 
                    Because they are covered by canopy of leaves by larger trees and get only small amounts of soft light, 
                    they do not need a lot of light as a potted plant. 
                    When owning one of these plants, you need to keep sure they get warm, high humid and evenly moist growing conditions. 
                    This makes them hard to keep alive and vibrant looking as potted.</p>
